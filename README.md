# SmartDeal
This is the official implementation for the paper "SmartDeal: Re-Modeling Deep Network Weights for Efficient Inference and Training" by Xiaohan Chen, Yang Zhao, Yue Wang, Pengfei Xu, Haoran You, Chaojian Li, Yonggan Fu, Yingyan Lin, and Zhangyang Wang.

The codes are divided into two parts of [efficient inference](https://github.com/VITA-Group/SmartDeal/tree/main/SmartDeal-Inference) and [efficient training](https://github.com/VITA-Group/SmartDeal/tree/main/SmartDeal-Training) using SmartDeal, respectively.

Coming soon!
